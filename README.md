# Creating a CI/CD Workflow a static blog webpage built on Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript, with Github action, AWS ECR and ECS


The source code was forked from the main source code repo 
- The orignal source code - https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter

The main source code for the project was in /examples/blog-starter

I forked that into my github repo and started work.

## Steps

The first thing i did was to test if the web page was accessible, by cloning the source code in my local repo and running it with nodejs.
